## ❓ Questions for You
1.  **Nutrition Strategy**: Building a food database (like MyFitnessPal) is massive. For MVP, do you want:
    *   A) Full manual entry (User types "Chicken Breast - 200cal").
    *   B) AI Text Entry (User types "I ate a chicken sandwich", AI estimates macros).
    *   C) Simple "Habit" checkboxes (e.g., "Ate Healthy", "Hit Protein Goal")?
2.  **Training Focus**: Is this app more for:
    *   Gym/Weightlifting (Strong/Hevy style)?
    *   Home/Calisthenics?
    *   Hybrid?
