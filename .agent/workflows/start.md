description: Initialize a new agent session by reading rules, workflows, and full project documentation.
---

1. **Read Project Rules**:
    - List and read all files in `[.agent/rules](file:///c:/Users/Ahmed/Desktop/Projects/Final/0/.agent/rules)`.
    - Pay special attention to `app-rules.md`.

2. **Read Master Workflow**:
    - Read `[WORKFLOW.md](file:///c:/Users/Ahmed/Desktop/Projects/Final/0/WORKFLOW.md)`.

3. **Load Project Context (CRITICAL)**:
    - You MUST read the current project status from `[PROJECT_STATUS.md](file:///c:/Users/Ahmed/Desktop/Projects/Final/0/docs/process/PROJECT_STATUS.md)` (if exists) or the latest implementation plans.
    - Run a recursive list of the `[docs](file:///c:/Users/Ahmed/Desktop/Projects/Final/0/docs)` directory.
    - Read the most recent/active implementation plans in `docs/planning` to understand what was just finished and what is next.
    - Read `[task.md](file:///c:/Users/Ahmed/.gemini/antigravity/brain/531742d6-17ee-432f-9437-fb3d64998fa0/task.md)` (check artifact directory) to see the immediate active task list.

4. **Ready State**:
    - Confirm you have loaded the context.
    - Summarize the current phase and immediate next steps based on the docs.
    - Ask the user for confirmation to proceed.
