description: Initialize a new agent session by reading rules and workflow.
---

1. Read the project rules from `[app-rules.md](file:///c:/Users/Ahmed/Desktop/Projects/Final/0/.agent/rules/app-rules.md)`.
2. Read the master workflow from `[WORKFLOW.md](file:///c:/Users/Ahmed/Desktop/Projects/Final/0/WORKFLOW.md)`.
3. Confirm that you have read the rules and workflow, and all the other documentations and explicitly ask the user what they would like to do next.
